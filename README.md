# Real-time Data Streaming and Analytics Platform

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a real-time data streaming and analytics platform in Java using Apache Kafka for data streaming and Apache Flink for data processing.

## Components

1. **Kafka Producer**: Produces sample data and publishes it to a Kafka topic.
2. **Kafka Consumer**: Consumes data from the Kafka topic and prints it to the console.
3. **Flink Job**: Reads data from Kafka, processes it using Flink, and performs basic analytics like word count.

## Usage

1. Start Apache Kafka and Apache Flink on your local machine or use a cloud-based service.
2. Run the Kafka Producer to generate sample data and publish it to a Kafka topic.
3. Run the Kafka Consumer to consume data from the Kafka topic and print it to the console.
4. Run the Flink Job to read data from Kafka, perform analytics, and print the results.

## Example

```bash
# Start Kafka Producer
java KafkaProducer

# Start Kafka Consumer
java KafkaConsumer

# Submit Flink Job
java FlinkJob

```

## Features

- **Real-time Data Streaming**: Utilizes Apache Kafka for high-throughput, low-latency data streaming.
- **Stream Processing**: Uses Apache Flink for real-time data processing and analytics.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale horizontally to handle large volumes of data.
- **Flexibility**: Supports various data sources and processing logic for diverse use cases.
